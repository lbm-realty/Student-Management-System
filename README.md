Student Management System

What’s This About?
This is a simple app I built using Spring Boot to manage student info, like names and ages. It lets you add, view, update, or delete student details through a web interface (API).

What It Can Do
    -> Add a new student to the system.
    -> Show a list of all students.
    -> Update a student’s info.
    -> Remove a student from the list.
    -> Saves everything in a database.

Tools I Used
    -> Code: Java and Spring Boot (to build the app)
    -> Database: MySQL (to store the data)
    -> Build: Maven (to put it all together)
    -> Testing: Postman (to check if it works)
